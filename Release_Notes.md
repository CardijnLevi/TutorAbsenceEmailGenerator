### Version Numbers
Version numbers distinguish between Major releases, Minor releases, and Micro releases.
**Major releases** are normally fundamental changes to the product. These are changes that affect the way the product serves the user, or the way the user interacts with the product.
**Minor releases** involve feature additions or removals.
**Micro releases** include small tweaks meant to fix bugs, or updates to existing features.

Version numbers are formatted as [Major Version].[Minor version].[Macro version] - for example, version 1.5.7 is major version 1, minor version 5, and macro version 7.

### Version Names
Each minor version is given a name as an additional way of keeping track of them. These version names are named after wind band composers, and are always in alphabetical order. See the [Version Names document](https://github.com/CardijnLevi/TutorAbsence/blob/c58736df1c44050a758bb1abb1461376ddb85def/Version_Names.md) for a list of names and composers.
