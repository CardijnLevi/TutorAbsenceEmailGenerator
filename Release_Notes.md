# TutorAbsence Email Generator Release Notes

##Version Numbers
Version numbers distinguish between Major releases, Minor releases, and Micro releases.
**Major releases** are normally fundamental changes to the product. These are changes that affect the way the product serves the user, or the way the user interacts with the product.
**Minor releases** involve feature additions or removals.
**Micro releases** include small tweaks meant to fix bugs, or updates to existing features.

Version numbers are formatted as [Major Version].[Minor version].[Macro version] - for example, version 1.5.7 is major version 1, minor version 5, and macro version 7.

##Version Names
Each minor version is given a name as an additional way of keeping track of them. These version names are named after significant wind band composers, and are always in alphabetical order. See the Version Names document for a list of names and composers.
